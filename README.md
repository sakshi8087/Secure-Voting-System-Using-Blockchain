## FAQs ❓

### What is Blockchain? 🌐
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple systems in a secure and immutable way. Each "block" of data is linked to the previous block, forming a secure "chain."

---

### How Does Blockchain Help in Voting Systems? 🗳️
- **Security**: Votes are encrypted and stored in an immutable ledger, making it nearly impossible to alter or tamper with data.
- **Transparency**: Each transaction (vote) is recorded and can be audited publicly.
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure ensures higher system reliability.
